Digital Assimilation And Virtual Assistant (DAVA)
DAVA is a website which helps hospitals and other health care centers during any kind of calamity. It is also dedicated for the help of rescue teams during any such condition. It basically collects information about all the hospitals of the calamity affected region and also that of the unaffected region. It also collects patient details of all the affected hospitals along with the medical condition of each patient. It also collects the accommodation capacity of the unaffected hospitals and the number of patients in each affected hospital. All of this work is done automatically by the website. It then prepares a route map for rescue teams for the rescue of patients and their safe and efficient transportation. This is done by finding the most suitable unaffected hospital where the patients from an affected hospital will be transported. This is done keeping in mind the distance between the two hospitals and relative beds available as compared to the patients. The front end of this website is built using materialize CSS, HTML, JavaScript. Backend is developed using NodeJS. Route map preparation is done using machine learning.
